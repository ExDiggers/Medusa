# AntiMoveHack
The worst anticheat of your dreams.

This anticheat is a big meme. I was bored and made this in a few hours. If you want to contribute, it would be appreciated, but don't take this anticheat seriously.
If you're going to make a pull request, it must only be optimizations, bug fixes, or movement checks. I will not accept any other form of checks except for movement.

To-do list:

-LARGELY improved base.

-Switching over to a packet based system

-Better collision utilities.
